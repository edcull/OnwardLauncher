                     Onward Version Switcher and Launcher
                               OnwardVSL v1.0
                      created by Archetek and BigWing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER: This solution uses a windows batch file to rename the Onward Steam Library
folders and launch the Onward Steam application. You should check the contents of batch
files before running on your own machine to ensure that there are no malicious commands.
I have tried to comment the commands as much as possible to help users understand what
they do.

CREDITS: This script just automates the process for switching Onward versions created by
BigWing and Ytrex, based on work by Monorchild. My thanks to BigWing for
extensive testing and troubleshooting.

CHANGES: This version aims to allow Steam updates to Onward 1.8. The aim here is to always
keep the 1.8 files in the Onward directory and only rename the folders to put 1.7 files in
the Onward directory when you are actually playing 1.7. With Steam updates disabled while
in game, this should prevent 1.8 updates trying to overwrite 1.7 files. To do this the
beta-opt in needs to be set to "None" and the 1.8 files need to restored after running 1.7.
This is highly experimental and may result in the 1.7/1.8 files getting mixed up resulting
in redownloading of both versions of the game


PREREQUISITES:

- Windows Operating System

- Steam version of Onward

- Following BigWing's instructions to install Onward 1.7 and Onward 1.8 Folders
  - This version aims to allow for 1.8 updates and requires the beta opt-in option to be set to "None"
	
- You should have either:
  - Onward 1.7 in the Onward folder and Onward 1.8 in the Onward18 folder
  - Onward 1.8 in the Onward folder and Onward 1.7 in the Onward17 folder

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Optional. Open the OnwardVSL.bat file in a text editor to check its contents
  are not malicious
  
- Copy the OnwardVSL.bat file into the parent folder of the Onward folders (The
  Steam library location containing Onward)
  i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common
  
- Run the OnwardVSL.bat file

- Optional. Choose the "0" option to automatically create a desktop shortcut

- Chose the "1" option to launch Onward 1.7, or the "2" option to launch Onward 1.8.
  - note: you can close the launcher immediately, but Onward may take a short time
    to check SteamVR is running before launching into VR
 

EXPLANATION:

The script prompts for the version of Onward the user wishes to launch (Options 1, 2, 3, or 4)

- Option 1 - For launching Onward 1.7:
  - The script will check for the presence of the "Onward17" folder alongside the active
    "Onward" folder
  - If the "Onward17" folder is found, it is assumed that the "Onward" folder contains
    Onward 1.8 and the "Onward17" folder contains the Onward 1.7 files
  - Accordingly, the script then renames the active "Onward" folder as "Onward18" and the
    "Onward17" folder to "Onward" to switch the active version to 1.7
  - The script then launches Onward (App ID:496240) using the steam.exe command line
    (the Steam executable location being taken from the registry)
  - The script them prompts for the window to be left open until after closing the game
  - Pressing enter will restore the 1.8 files into the "Onward" folder and 1.7 files into
    the "Onward17" folder 
  - The script then exits automatically
  
- Option 2 - For launching Onward 1.8:
  - The script will check for the presence of the "Onward18" folder alongside the active
    "Onward" folder
  - If the "Onward18" folder is found, it is assumed that the "Onward" folder contains
    Onward 1.7 and the "Onward18" folder contains the Onward 1.8 files
  - Accordingly, the script then renames the active "Onward" folder as "Onward17" and the
    "Onward18" folder to "Onward" to switch the active version to 1.8
  - The script then launches Onward (App ID:496240) using the steam.exe command line
   (the Steam executable location being taken from the registry)
  - The script then exits automatically

- Option 3 - For manually restoring 1.8 filescreating a Desktop Shortcut
  - The script will restore the 1.8 files into the "Onward" folder and 1.7 files into the "Onward17" folder 
  
- Option 4 - For creating a Desktop Shortcut
  - The script creates a temporary VBScript to create a Desktop Shortcut to the batch file
